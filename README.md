## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 18.0.0)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

Use this template(Recommended) or clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankitdev10/nest-starter.git
cd your-repo
pnpm install # npm install or yarn install
```

### Usage

## Run Development Server

Update `API_HOST` and `API_PORT` variables in your `.env` as per your need. If not provided, the server will start on `http://localhost/3000` by default.

```bash
pnpm start:dev # or yarn start:dev or npm run start:dev
```

## Build for production

```bash
pnpm build # or yarn build or npm run build
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
pnpm lint # or yarn lint or npm run lint
```

### Database Setup

Update following vairables in your `.env` file according to the database you prefer. Example for postgres is shown below:

```bash
DB_TYPE=postgres
DB_URL="postgres://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@localhost:5432/<DB_NAME>"
```

### Code Generation

Refactor codegen.json file on the root of the directory to point to your graphql schemas.

```bash
pnpm codegen # or yarn codegen or npm run codegen
```

### Transactional DB Calls
## Credit goes to [BijanRegmi](https://github.com/BijanRegmi) for coming up with this solution.
 
To implement [Transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction), we can use ``Transaction`` decorator as such

```js
  @Mutation()
  @Transaction()
  async createUser() {
    return this.testService.createUser();
  }
```

Further we can use ``TransactionalConnection`` service to get and manage repositories for CRUD operations.

```js
async createUser(ctx: RequestContext, user: MutationCreateUserArgs) {
    const savedUser = await this.transaction
      .getRepository(ctx, User)
      .save(new User(user));

    return savedUser;
  }
```

### Test

Once the application is up and running. Open your favorite browser and visit `YOUR_ENDPOINT/graphql` to get access to graphql playground. Run the following query to test the server.

```graphql
query {
  greet(name: "YOUR_NAME")
}
```

This query as the name suggests, welcomes you to the graphql world.

## Note: Every block of code can be found in the code.
